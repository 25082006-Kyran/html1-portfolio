<h1>I love you so much</h1>


 <h2> My Dearest Buby,</h2>

<p>Every moment we share feels like a beautiful dream, one that I never want to wake up from. From the first time we met, something about you captivated me — not just the way you smile or the kindness in your eyes, but the depth of who you are. You’ve brought so much light into my life, and I am constantly amazed by your strength, your warmth, and the love you give so freely. There is no greater joy for me than knowing I get to spend each day by your side, growing together, laughing together, and loving each other.</p>

<p>I find myself thinking about you in the quiet moments, when I’m lost in my thoughts or caught up in the everyday bustle. Your voice is the sweetest melody in my mind, and the way your hand feels in mine is a comfort I never knew I needed until I found you. Every conversation with you, every smile shared, feels like a gift, and I cherish each one more than words can express. You are my greatest adventure, my safest place, and my heart’s truest home.</p>

<p>I promise to always stand by you, through all of life’s ups and downs. I want to be the person who makes you feel loved every single day, in ways both big and small. You are everything I never knew I needed and everything I now can’t imagine living without. Thank you for being you, for sharing your heart with me, and for allowing me to be a part of your beautiful world. I love you more than I can ever truly put into words.</p>

<h3>Forever yours</h3>
